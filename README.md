## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This is the py file containing my commonly occurring `administrative` functions.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
There are several useful functionings dealing with i/o, python basic data type manipulations, and other functions that will enjoy heavy repetition in use throughout my portfolio, such as complex pandas operations. This is a single update point for all of those functions.
## This project leverages the following libraries:
pandas, fuzzywuzzy
## This project does not require any special setup steps.

## The expected frequency for running this code is as follows:
As Needed
